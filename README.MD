## Jenkins Dashboard

### Getting Started

* install [RVM](https://rvm.io/)

### Populating your local database

There is a rake task available which will populate the database with all job data for each job shown on the 'Wall Display' view inside Jenkins. To run the rake task call

This may take some time depending on the amount of jobs displayed on on the 'Wall Display' view.
