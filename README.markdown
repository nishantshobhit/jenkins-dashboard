### Dependencies 

* [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)
* [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) (recommended)
* [git plugin fork](https://github.com/alexefish/git-plugin)

### Gems

See the the Gemfile for a full list of gems. 

### Configuration

Jenkins Dashboard requires some simple configuration to communicate with your Jenkins installation. 

The [jenkins.yml](https://github.com/ustwo/jenkins-dashboard/blob/master/config/jenkins.yml) file requires a key, client id and URL for to access your Jenkins installation API.

    defaults: &defaults
      client_key: your_client_key
      client_id: your_client_id
      client_url: your_client_url

#### Jenkins Configuration

If you wish to display git stats for your jobs and builds you will need to install [this fork](https://github.com/alexefish/git-plugin) of the Jenkins Git Plugin. The plugin will expose git stats to the Jenkins Dashboard not available with the default Jenkins Plugin.

You will also need to create a Jenkins View named `WallDisplay`, all jobs added to this view will be available to the Jenkins Dashboard, this can be done at the `/newView` path of your Jenkins installation.

### Usage

Ensure you have a postgreSQL installation running then run the following commands to create the database and schema:

    $ rake db:create:all
    $ rake db:migrate

You can then start the application. 

#### Fetching jobs

Jenkins Dashboard implements the [whenever](https://github.com/javan/whenever) gem to fetch jobs via a cron job, see schedule.rb for configuration. 

    every 1.minutes do
      runner "US2::Jenkins.instance.sync", :environment => :production
    end

You will need to write to your system/servers crontab to start the cron job using the command: `whenever -w`. For capistrano instructions see the [whenever](https://github.com/javan/whenever) readme. 

#### Populating the database

There is a rake task available which will traverse through your Jenkins history and populate the database with all jobs. 

    rake populate

See issue #1.

#### Running tests

To run tests locally simply execute the `guard` command.
